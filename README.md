##  ðŸ’» About the project</br>

The main objective of this project was to analyze the historical data of video game sales to draw conclusions about which parameters are most critical for success in creating a game and then compare the insights with the results of a regression model.

## ðŸ›  Data Analysis (Tableau):

Sales:

- If we look at the 2016 scenario, the North American region is the biggest video gamesâ€™ market in terms of sales in 2016. Which suggests that NA players' preferences should be taken into serious consideration by game developers;

- Despite the drop in the curve, this does not mean that the market has weakened, quite the opposite, as the dataset only shows the year the game was released and the total sales through 2016. It is natural that games released more recently have fewer sales (with a few exceptions). If data showed the sales per year, the curve would probably be growing continuously.

- Games released in 2008 has the most sales in 2016 compare to others. This makes 2008 a very important year for the video games industry, which was when the 7th generation of consoles were launched (Xbox360, PS3, Wii, DS and PSP).

Platform (Manufacturer):

- Top selling manufacturers were Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, respectively.

Genre:

- We can see that the Action, Sports and Shooter genres, in that order, have had the most sales over the years.

- If we filter each of the top 3 manufacturers (Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft) the top 3 genres varies:
    - Nintendo top genres are Platform, Action and Misc (even with 'Wii Sports'/'Wii Sports Resort' being in the top 4 best selling video games in history!);
    - Sony top genres are Action, Sports and Shooter;
    - Microsoft top genres are Shooter, Action and Sports.

Rating:

- The most popular ratings in terms of total sales were E (Everyone), T (teens) and M (Mature).

## ðŸ›  Data Analysis (Machine Learning):

Of the three models, the one with the best parameters was the first model, although the parameters obtained were not satisfactory.

RÂ²: The value was a little low, as it only explains 46% of the variability of the response data around its mean.

RMSE: If we look at the average sales value (US$ 690k), we can say that the RMSE was relatively high (i.e. a forecast of US$ 430k made from sales, a value not too far from the average, can actually be a total sales failure and result in US$ 0 in sales).

ÃŸ values: As shown in the graph below, the variables that have the most positive influence on the amount of sales, according to the model, are K-A and RP ratings, Nintendo and Sony manufacturers, and Misc and Fighting genres.

##  ðŸ’» Result Analysis:

The analyses obtained from the historical data (dashboard) proved to be more enlightening for decision making, due to the not so satisfactory results of the linear regression models.

The gaming industry grows every year, so looking at this history before creating a new game or even investing in a game given its parameters of what platform it will be released on, what genre and rating, and what region the market will focus on, is very important.

The next steps to complement this analysis would be the development of better regression models (testing other types of regression, not only linear) to try to find a model that makes a more assertive prediction, using the parameters of the database.
